# Machine Learning Course - Claude Assistant Guidelines

## Project Structure
This is a 15-week ML course organized by weekly modules:

```
01_Introduction_to_ML/
02_Linear_Regression/
03_Logistic_Regression/
04_Neural_Networks/
...
(add more weeks as course progresses)
```

## Directory Structure per Week
Each week follows this structure:
- `exercises/` - Exercise files (exercise01.py, exercise02.py, etc.)
- `resources/` - PDFs, lecture notes, datasets, reference materials
- `assignments/` - Homework and project submissions
- `notes.md` - Personal notes and summaries

## Naming Conventions
- Exercises: `exercise01.py`, `exercise02.py`, `exercise03.py`, etc.

- Resources: Keep original names for PDFs and datasets
- Notes: `notes.md` in each week folder

## Commands to Remember
- Python environment: (add your preferred environment setup)
- Testing: (add testing framework if used)
- Jupyter notebooks: (if using notebooks)

## Course Goals
- Complete all exercises to perfection
- Maintain clean, well-documented code
- Build comprehensive understanding of ML concepts
- Create a reference library for future use

## Notes for Claude
- Always check existing code style and follow conventions
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Focus on educational clarity in code examples
- Help with exercise completion and concept understanding
